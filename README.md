# Powerball

## Intro

The idea of this repository is to use some basic statistics and programming knowledge to "predict" the next powerball draw. This is for fun and should not be taken as a legitimate prediction method. You will lose money.

## Statistical Basis

There are some initial assumptions that are made.

1. The balls used to draw the Powerball are used again and again though are eventually replaced.
2. Each ball has slight differences even though the manufacturing process is identical for each.
3. The process of drawing the balls does not change.

With these in mind the idea will be outlined in depth in a blog post at a later time.
